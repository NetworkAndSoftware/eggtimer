Egg Timer

A simple, easy to use egg timer for Windows. 

It's a small Windows Forms app I wrote in 2006. Still works in 2017 and if you're like me, often behind a PC and you forget things like the water you were boiling, it can be handy.
Originally written for Visual Studio 2005, I've converted the project to Visual Studio 2010.
